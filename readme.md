## Prerequisites
- Access to MindSphere Remote Service App
- Debian based device which should be connected via MindSphere Remote Service

## Setup & Configuration

### Debian
To use the MRS client on a Debian based system, download the respective client from your MRS app on MindSphere as shown in the documentation. Next, store the client on the device and then start the service. The following step-by-step guide will help you doing so.

1. On your device, browse to directory where the MRS-Client .tar.gz file is located
2. Expand the archive-file (=untar)  
    ```tar -xvzf <your-client-download-file>.tar.gz```  
3. Change access rights to the mrs-client using if needed
    ```sudo chmod +x mrs-client```
4. Start the client using ```./mrs-client```
5. After the client is running, you need to accept the terms using ```y```(es), then the following screen should occur.

> **_NOTE:_**  By default, the device client does not have an autostart function enabled. Meaning everytime the device is e.g. restarted, the client needs to be started manually again. 
> To change this behaviou, follow herebelow described setup. 

Optional: **Enable autostart**
To make the client run automatically, e.g. after a power-out of the device, a service needs to be registered in Debian for this. 
Please note that this mechanism is not formally supported but a community contribution. For production usage, no liabiltiy is taken, neither support provided. Consulting of a skilled Debian developer is highly recommended and the guide below just serves as helper. 
1) copy the [MRS_autostart_installer](/resources/setup.sh) to the directoy of the unzipped MRS device client. 
2) run the installer using ```sudo sh ./setup.sh```

You should then find the client in the list of services of you system.

To **check the service** locally on the device and see if the MRS-Service is still running, you can view the system-services running ```sudo systemctl status mrs-client```

To uninstall/**disable autostart**, simply run [MRS_autostart_uninstaller](/resources/uninstall.sh) from the directory where you previously executed the ```./setup.sh``` from. 

### Windows  
... to follow later

## Result
Successfull installation/or running of the client can also be checked easily right on MindSphere using the online-status indicator in the MRS application. 

Next you can add desired remote protocol applications (e.g. SSH/RDP/VNC/...) or utilize the file-share option for your remote device through the MindSphere app.
